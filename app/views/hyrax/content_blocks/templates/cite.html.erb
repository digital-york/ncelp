<p>Note: Sometimes individual authors are listed on some of the materials, and those authors' 
names can be used instead of 'NCELP'. For the in-text citation, this would be "Kasprowicz (2020)". 
For the reference this would be "Kasprowicz, R. (2020)". [followed by the reference as above]. 
However, most of the time "NCELP" as the author is the most appropriate.</p>
