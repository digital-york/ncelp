## About us

The National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy (NCELP) is funded by the Department for Education (DfE) and co-managed by The University of York and The Cam Academy Trust.

We work in partnership with university researchers, teacher educators and expert practitioners, and with 18 Specialist Teachers in nine Leading Schools across the country acting as language hubs, to improve language curriculum design and pedagogy, leading to a higher take up and greater success at GCSE.

Our substantial package of support includes professional development tools, teaching resources, and workshops, and takes forward the recommendations made in the Teaching Schools Council’s Modern Foreign Languages Pedagogy Review led by headteacher and linguist Ian Bauckham, and ensures they are achievable and effective in schools.

## Quick start
0. Assume that Docker is available
```
❯ docker-compose --version                                                                 ═
docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```
Generate local ssh key
```
ssh-keygen -i rsa docker/ncelp_id_rsa
```

1. Set .env with Docker variables. Use .env.template as starting point
```
cp .env.template .env
```
Customise as required

2. Set config/application.yml
```
ncelp_host: http://localhost:3000
development:
  application_database_adapter: postgresql
  application_database_name: ncelp
  application_database_host: postgresdb
  # application_database_host: 127.0.0.1
  application_database_username: ncelp
  application_database_password: ncelp
  #derivatives_path: tmp/ncelp-derivatives
  fedora_base_path: /ncelp-development
  # fedora_url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/fcrepo/rest
  fedora_url: http://fcrepo:8080/fcrepo/rest
  # fits_path: /Users/sp1487/fits-1.4.1/fits.sh
  fits_path: /fits/fits.sh
  log_level: error
  redis_namespace: ncelp-public
  realtime_notifications: 'false'
  redis_host: redis
  redis_port: '6379'
  # solr_url: http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/hyrax_production
  solr_url: http://solr:8983/solr/hyrax_production
  # Generate and add secrets `rails secrets`   
  # secret_key_base: 

```
3. Build docker images. Note this will take up to 1h depending on network and laptop speed.
```
❯ docker-compose build 

# Check if images exists
❯ docker-compose images                                                                  ═ ✹

4. Start your docker stack
```
❯ docker-compose up
...
lots of logs
...

# Check status from an other terminal
❯ docker-compose ps                                                                  ⏎ ═ ✹ ✚

```

5. How to modify application code
The local source code is shared with Docker ${APP_DIR} volume. Refresh browser to see any changes to .erb files (Note, this is only while RAILS_ENV=development)

If you make changes to the *.rb, Gemfile or the Compose file to try out some different configurations, you need to rebuild. Some changes require only ```docker-compose up --build```, but a full rebuild requires a re-run of ```docker-compose run web bundle install``` to sync changes in the ```Gemfile.lock``` to the host, followed by ```docker-compose up --build```.

If you need update some gems run ```bundle lock --update``` following re-build 
```
# Example: Bump up rack and nokogiri gems
docker-compose run web bundle lock --update rack nokogiri 
docker-compose build
```

6. Clean start
Hyrax data are stored in various location. Occassionally Fedora, Solr and Hyrax DB are not synchronised. In this case a full refresh of stored data is required. Follow those commands:
```
# remove images
docker-compose rm
# prune all data volumes
docker volume prune
```

7. Avaiable web services
NCELP app http://127.0.0.1:3000. Sign in as admin user with qazwsx:ncelp-admin@york.ac.uk at http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/sign_in

Access Fedora store http://127.0.0.1:8080/fcrepo

Access Solr admin interface http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/#/

8. Direct acces to stored data
If you need access to a data volume, one approach will be mounting a volume to ad hoc busybox container. For example, to remove a flag that indicates that application was installed during the first build _$APP_WORKDIR/shared/state/.initialized_, use this command
``` 
docker run --rm -i -v=ncelp-mac_state:/tmp/ncelp-mac_state busybox rm /tmp/ncelp-mac_state/.initialized
```
The container will be removed (--rm) after completing this opperation.
